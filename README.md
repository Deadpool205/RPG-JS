# RPG-JS
An RPG-Bot for Discord, written in Discord.js.  
Abandoned.

Deadpool has revived this from the original abondonment of this child... Updating the code to work with the latest node and Discord JS. You need to run node 12.0+ now for Discord 12.0+ to work properly. Discord 12+ introduced changes to called functions and much better handling tasks, especially local data storage.

Registering takes place in DM.
